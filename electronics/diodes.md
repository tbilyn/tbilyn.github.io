Diodes allow current to flow only in one direction.

They have to terminals: **anode** (positive) and **cathode** (negative). Conventional current can flow from anode to cathode (forward direction), but not the other direction (idelally).

### Diode States
Diode is **forward biased** (on) when voltage across a diode *is not* negative. 

Diode is **reverse biased** (off) when voltage across a diode is negative and no current flows. Anode is at a lower voltage than cathode.

**Breakdown** - when a voltage applied across a diode is very large and negative - it allows the current to flow in the reverse direction (from cathode to anode).

#### Current-Voltage (i-v) Relationship
 
The i-v curve of a diode is entirely non-linear.

### Electrical Characterisitcs

**Forward voltage (V<sub>F</sub>)** - minimal voltage that should be applied across a diode to allow the flow of the current. 
That's also a voltage drop cross a diode. V<sub>F</sub> is sometimes called either the cut-in voltage or on-voltage. 
Forward voltage depends on what semiconductor material diode is made out of: a silicon diode will have a V<sub>F</sub> around 0.6-1V, a germanium-based - around 0.3V. 
V<sub>F</sub> also depends on a type of a diode: LEDs can have much larger and Schottky diodes are designed specifically to have a much lower-than-usual forward voltage.

**Breakdown Voltage (V<sub>BR</sub>)** - if a large enough negative voltage is applied to the diode, it will give in and allow current to flow in the reverse direction. Normally, breakdown voltage is around -50V to -100V.

Diode can dissipate only so much power (just as any electrical component).
