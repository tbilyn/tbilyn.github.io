# Electro-Magnetic Waves

```
Speed of light ~ 3 * 10^8 m/s
```
#### Right-hand rule

Propagation of wave: put hand with fingers staright in the direction of electric field (E), than band them in direction of magnetic field (B), thumb will show propagation direction (K)
```
lambda = frequency * C
```
### Intensity (S, w/m2)
S = Power / Area
